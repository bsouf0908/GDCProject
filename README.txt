#Synergist

hi, thanks for downloading syrup lite rpg framework!
this is the sample project where you can find the scripts, and test the game for yourself to see how it works.

to run the sample project, you'll first need to download renpy from here:
https://renpy.org/latest.html

next, place the project folder into your ren'py folder
when you open the ren'py launcher, "Synergist" should appear in the sidebar!

please replace the art assets with your own work! i left them in only as placeholders.
all the code is 100% okay to use and modify for your game, including commercial projects.
i only ask that you credit me somewhere, and if possible, link back to my itch.io page so others can find it!

documentation/beginner guide can be downloaded from here:

feel free to contact me with comments, questions, or whatever else. i'll try to respond!
